Restaurant Pancake is a fictional restaurant ordering management application. It was one of my Application Development exam preparation project. I chose to build this using Django version 1.11 since this is where I feel most comfortable.

Project description:
Restaurant Pancake wants the ability to let customers order their food from their table. In order to that every table at the restaurant will get a tablet, which they can use to select the items they want to order. When they order, the kitchen will see what items were ordered from which table.

Learning process:
A lot of things I did in this project were not that hard for me anymore. But this was the first I needed to implement Django's Sessions. I still do not understand fully how to use them, but that's just a matter of practicing.
